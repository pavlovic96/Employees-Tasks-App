## Room for Improvement
- Tracking Completed and Uncompleted Tasks: it would be good to add a feature that allows users to easily track the number of completed and uncompleted tasks. This would provide users with a visual representation of their progress and help them better manage their tasks.

- Percentage of Success: Another valuable metric we can incorporate is the percentage of success. By calculating the ratio of completed tasks to the total number of tasks, we can provide users with a percentage that reflects their overall success rate.
